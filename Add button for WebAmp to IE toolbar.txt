Ok I updated this project to allow you to add a button for IE Webamp
in the Internet Explorer Toolbar. All this requires is to add some
values to the registry. They are as follows

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Extensions\{58C8F974-6F2B-471E-A0C8-10776537AB9E}]
"BandCLSID"="{2616531D-FA53-408B-87AA-2A874972B272}"
"ButtonText"="IE Webamp"
"CLSID"="{E0DD6CAB-2D10-11D2-8F1A-0000F87ABD16}"
"Icon"="default icon for the button"
"HotIcon"="Path to icon you want displayed as mouse is passed over the button"

Ok now to explain this. The first CLSID {58C8F974-6F2B-471E-A0C8-10776537AB9E} is 
a random GUID generated by GUIDGEN. It has to be a unique GUID and you need a program to 
generate this. It came with Visual Studio 6 and is called GUIDGEN.EXE. If you don't have it
you could probably find it on the microsoft page.
The second Entry is the CLSID of the Explorer Band which in this case is the CLSID for
IE Webamp.
The next is for the button text...pretty self explanitory.
the next Entry is for Explorer Band Extensions...this tells IE to open an Explorer Band and
must always be kept the same for opening bands. there are other values for executing programs 
etc.
The next two are self explanitory as well..they are the icons for the button

Hope this helps someone!!!!
