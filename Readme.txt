IEWebamp is a simple mp3 player that will teach you how to make explorer
band addons for Internet Explorer.
For the VB project you will need the windows media player, ms common dialog
and ms common controls components as well as a refernce to the vbshell type 
library (vbshell.tlb) to add this go to Project | References in visual
basic and browse to the vbshell.tlb.

To use IEWebamp simply Register the dll that comes with it then search
the registry for IEWebamp and make sure the CLSID matches the one in 
the webamp.reg file that comes with the source code.  If they don't match
then change the clsid in the reg file to the one that corresponds with IE
Webamps CLSID on your system and run the registry file. To use IEWebamp
open up Internet Explorer and go to View | Explorer Bar | and hit IE Webamp

needs...if you need help email me @ xTrin@snip.net and don't forget
